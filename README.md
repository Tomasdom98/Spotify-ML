# Spotify-ML
Grouping Spotify songs of the same style with Machine Learning (unsupervise learning). With a database containing many different songs with different parameters (popularity, danceability, valence, energy, explicit, key, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo) we group the songs into different groups of the same music style.
